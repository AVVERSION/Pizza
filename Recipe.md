Spread all over finely and make sure no spot is left. Spread the chicken, Golden corn (vegetables, if you took it) and spread it over randomly to give the look of a dominos pizza. The're good. preheat the oven to the highest temperature, 220 to 240 C for atleast 25 to 30 mins. Bake pizza till golden brown, crisp and cheese is golden brown. Sprinkle oregano and chilli flakes (absolutely necessary) and enjoy your pizza.
