Mozzarella Cheese (enough to cover the whole pizza. Rest up to you)
Tomato Sauce (enought to spread across the whole pizza. But believe me, you won't like a lot of it.)
Pizza base (What else will you make your pizza on??ü§™)
golden corn (specially needed for a lip smaking pizza)
chicken of choice (make sure it's juicy {not the drinking juice kind})
throw in a basil (just for decoration)
choice of sliced vegetables (SERIOUSLY NOT RECOMMENDED. Just adding so some fitness freaks don't complain abt itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
